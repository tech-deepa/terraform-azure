Terraform provider
----------------------------

Provider is the interface that interacts with the third party cloud provider apis.
As different cloud provides has different ways of interacting and sending data, for each cloud provider we have different providers.

Terraform file
--------------------

Terraform file will be created with .tf 
The steps to run tf file is -

Terraform init 
Terraform validate
Terraform paln
Terraform apply

Terraform checks the desired state with actual state when we run Terraform plan/apply.
It creates and deleted the resource to match the desired state.
If there is some modification in desired state, it can update/delete the infrastrcture.

--------------------------------
Statefile(remote backend)

Terraform statefile has details of the acutal state of the infrastrcture.
So that need to stored safely, so we are storing it in remote storage like s3 bucket or azure blob.
And we also need to maintain state locking, i.e we need to prevent people applying chaning simultaneously.
s3 bucket - dynamo db
azure blob by default support state locking.

-------------------------------------------------

Variables:
The variable is used to pass the required value at time of execution.
The variables can be passed from the .tfvars file, command line, ENV
There are precedenced for passing variable, when all are used.
1. Passing from command line (ex: Terraform paln -var variable_name = value )
2. Passing in the .tfvars (ex: Terraform plan -var-file = file.tfvars )
3. Environment variable (ex: export TF_VAR_variable = value)
4. default value   

Locals:
used for the paramter which need no to be changed or overriden

Output:
Used to print result needed after infrastrcture is created.
